This website is inspired on the course HTML and CSS created by MirosÅ‚aw Zelent, author of blog Pasja Informatyki.

================================================================================

0. "Potrfolio" - rightly this is a project made based on the Zelent's code. The goal was to become familiar with the basic structures in web technologies. During coding I've gained experience with the practical knowledge about basics of writing the first webpage.

HTML: structure -> <head> / <body> / <h> / <p> / <br> / <div class> / <div id>
CSS: content -> width / height / color / font-family / font-size / margin / padding / text-align
