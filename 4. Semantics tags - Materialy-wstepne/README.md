This website is inspired on the course HTML and CSS created by Mirosław Zelent, author of blog Pasja Informatyki.

4. "Materiały wstępne do kursu programowania" - is an example website with subpages (implemented only two: "słowniczek pojęć" and "GIT"). I am the author of this text. The main goal was to implement an 'index.html' and two another one pages, which after clicking will open another subpage. I've gained experience with the practical knowledge about using HTML local links. It was the first time when I used semantic tags.

HTML: structure -> section / header / article / aside / a href ="#" / figure / figcaption

CSS: content ->  float:left
