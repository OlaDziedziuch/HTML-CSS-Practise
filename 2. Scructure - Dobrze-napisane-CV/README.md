2. "Dobrze napisane CV" - is an example website with article about tips to write an effective resume. I am the author of this text. The main goal was to implement a page containing table of contents, which after clicking on a given chapter, user is redirected to a specific section. During coding I've gained experience with the practical knowledge about using two types of list and how to create tables. 

HTML: structure -> script tag / list / unordered list / ordered list / table 

CSS: content ->  styling links / display selector / position selector
