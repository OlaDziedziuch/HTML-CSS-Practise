3. "Guinea Pigs" - is an example website with pictures that have special effects. The main goal was to implement a page containing hover efects, which will be correctly read by most search engines using the Webkit (e.g Chrome, Safari) and MS (Internet Explorer;)). I've gained experience with the practical knowledge about using pseudo classes (a:link, a:hover, a:visited, a:active).

CSS: content ->  pseudo classes / hover effects
