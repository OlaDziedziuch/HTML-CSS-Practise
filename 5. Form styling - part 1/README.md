5. "Stylizowanie formularzy" - is an example website containing simple login form. The main goal was to learn the basic styling of form elements. I've gained experience with the practical knowledge how to works.

HTML: structure -> form / input type='text' / input type='password'/ input type='submit' / placeholder

CSS: content ->  box-shadow / border / border-radius
