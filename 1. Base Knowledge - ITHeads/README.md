This website is inspired on the course HTML and CSS created by MirosÅ‚aw Zelent, author of blog Pasja Informatyki.

1. "IT Heads" - company's website was a first project created in these web technologies. The goal was to implement a page containing a menu bar, text field and fields with links to subpages. During coding I've gained experience with the practical knowledge about structure and content of the website.

HTML: structure -> tags - div / head / body / metadata / link / images / class / id 

CSS: content -> cascade / attribute / selector / class / id / child / parent
